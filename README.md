# FC-Neural-Net-From-Scratch
 In this project, I have built a fully connected neural net for the MNIST digit recognition task (this is the 
MNIST_fullyconnected.ipynb file).
 
 This method was learned from Andrew Ng in the DeepLearning.ai Deep Learning Specialization.
 
 I have included some screenshots from the course which aided me in writing my functions.
